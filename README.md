## Project Description

The **Resume to JSON Converter** is a Python-based web application that allows users to upload a resume in plain text format (TXT). The app parses the content of the resume, extracts important information (such as Personal Information, Education, Skills, Experience, Projects, and Certifications), and outputs the parsed data in a structured JSON format, which the user can download. 

This tool is ideal for developers who need to process resumes programmatically, or for HR systems that rely on structured data formats for candidate analysis.

## Features

- **Upload Resume**: The user can upload their resume in plain text format.
- **Resume Parsing**: Automatically extracts key information such as personal details, education, work experience, projects, and certifications.
- **JSON Download**: After parsing, the user can download the resume in JSON format.
- **Responsive Design**: The web interface adapts to different screen sizes (desktop and mobile).
- **Modern UI**: A clean, advanced interface with animation, gradients, and a glassmorphism-style container.
  
## Technologies Used

### Backend:
- **Python**: Main programming language used.
- **Flask**: Lightweight web framework for handling server-side logic.
- **re (Regular Expressions)**: Used for parsing resume content.
  
### Frontend:

### Other Tools:
- **Bootstrap (optional)**: Can be integrated for easier styling.
- **JSON**: Output format for parsed resume data.
